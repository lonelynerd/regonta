# Re:Gonta

Does stuff. Sends memes. Crashes. Restarts. It's that simple.
---

### Disclaimer !
This bot is currently under intense development, so don't expect something perfectly optimised and/or bug free. Plus, the wording of some messages may sound weird, don't worry, it's going to be fixed in the near future.

## What can I do with it ?

- **say** (msg) : let your bot say things
- **listen** (n) : fetch the last n messages in your terminal
- **sidejack** : take control of the bot and send messages through the terminal

- **meme** : send a random meme from a meme folder

- **info** : get basic informations about the bot
- **exit** : stop the bot remotely

**MORE FEATURES ARE COMING, STAY TUNED !**

## Where do I start ?

- Install the required modules :
```pip install discord.py```
- Put the needed informations in the ```config.json``` file
- Run the thing :
```python3 bot.py```
- You're done !

## How can I help ?

- If you find a bug, don't hesitate to send me a mail :
```imalonelynerd@gmail.com```
- Since the whole project is under the **Unlicense**, you can fork it, edit it, resell it, I don't care.
